# Word Search Game

A simple word search game built using Java and Swing. This game allows users to find words from a randomly generated grid based on the selected difficulty level.

## Features

- **Random Word Placement:** Words are placed randomly in the grid in various directions (horizontal and vertical | forward and backward).
- **Difficulty Levels:** Users can select from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, which determine the number of words to find.
- **Graphical User Interface:** The game uses Java Swing for a simple and intuitive GUI.
- **Dynamic Word Selection:** Words are dynamically selected from a predefined list based on the difficulty level.
